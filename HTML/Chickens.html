        <h1>Chicken</h1>

        <hr>

        <p> The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl species that is originally from
            Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
            junglefowl,
            Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger
            male
            may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen,
            and a
            sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
            both
            their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still
            practiced
            in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>
        <p>
            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of 2018,<sup><a href="somesource.com">[2]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more
            chickens in the world than any other bird.
            There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language
            and
            literature.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p> Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally
            a
            term
            only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and
            scientific
            contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]</p>

        <h2>Biology and habitat </h2>
        <p>Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
            even
            animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]

            The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken
            lived
            for 16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]
